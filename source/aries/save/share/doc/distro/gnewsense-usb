If you got a USB memory stick you can boot gNewSense live as with the cd. What you will need:

  • A USB stick 1 GB+
  • A motherboard that support booting from removables.
  • A computer with usb ports with GNU/Linux or Windows running.

Make your stick bootable

This will guide you to make the stick bootable. We are going to use syslinux for it.

Install syslinux

Choose the operating system you run. GNU/Linux or Windows.

GNU/Linux

Syslinux may already be installed in your system. Type syslinux in a terminal. If the command is not
found you have to install it from your distribution's repository. On a Debian/Ubuntu system this is
done like this:

apt-get install syslinux

You can also run the following commands in a terminal:

wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-3.83.tar.bz2
tar -xvjf syslinux-3.83.tar.bz2
cd syslinux-3.83/unix

Now you got syslinux ready to use. Keep the terminal window up so you can use it later.

Windows

Download a syslinux zip-file from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/.
Unpack it.
Have up your terminal by clicking Start and then Run, type cmd and press Enter.
Cd to the directory where you unpacked syslinux, cd Desktop should work if you unpacked it to your
desktop and if the terminal started in your user directory.
Type cd syslinux-3.83 or whatever version you have downloaded.
Finally type cd win32 to get into the windows binary.
Now you got syslinux ready to use. Keep the terminal window up so you can use it later.

Install mbr

GNU/Linux

mbr may already be installed in your system. Type install-mbr in a root terminal. If the command is not
found you have to install it from your distribution's repository. On a Debian/Ubuntu system this is
done like this:

apt-get install mbr

Partition the stick

Usually USB sticks are already partitioned with a FAT partition. If your USB stick is completely empty,
you need to use fdisk to partition it:

mocca:~# fdisk /dev/sdf
Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x85934366.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): p

Format the stick

Again, usually USB sticks are already formatted. If you want to-reformat it, you can do it like this:

In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>mkfs.vfat /dev/sdf1

Run syslinux

Run the syslinux command shown below, in the window we set up earlier, assuming drive name is sdb1 or
F:.

In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>syslinux -s /dev/sdb1

$ sudo syslinux -s /dev/sdb1
sh: mcopy: command not found
syslinux: failed to create ldlinux.sys
$ c-aries
= =b > install mtools
$

In Windows:<<BR>>syslinux.exe -s -m F:

Install the master boot record

The master boot record must be installed on

In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>install-mbr /dev/sdb

Mount the stick

In the most modern operating systems USB memory sticks get mounted automatically.

If not and if you use a GNU/Linux distribution run mount: mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
You have to run the command as root or sudo. You also have to create the directory usb with mkdir /
media/usb, or choose a mount point at your opinion.
The device name may also be different. Run dmesg | tail in a terminal after you have plugged in the
stick.
Look for [sdb] or any similar. Add a 1 to it so it knows it is the first partition.

Copy files from the gNewSense iso

Download a gNewSense iso from http://cdimage.gnewsense.org/ You can burn the iso to a cd and copy the
files to the stick, but it is faster to mount the iso.

In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>mkdir /media/iso
mount -oloop /path/to/gnewsense-livecd-deltah-2.3.iso /media/iso
Again, it has to be done as root or sudo.

In Windows you can use a program called Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel. Download it, unpack it and read
it's readme for how to use it.
http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/
winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe

Copy the casper directory to the memory stick. Copy the content of the isolinux directory to the memory
stick. Rename isolinux.bin to syslinux.bin. Rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg.

In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>cp -r /media/iso/casper/ /media/usb/
cp /media/iso/isolinux/* /media/usb/
mv /media/usb/isolinux.bin /media/usb/syslinux.bin
mv /media/usb/isolinux.cfg /media/usb/syslinux.cfg

Unmount the memory stick to write cache. In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>umount /media/usb

Unmount the ISO image. In GNU/Linux:<<BR>>umount /media/iso

Memory sticks not automounted-fix

If you installed gNewSense from the memory stick the same memory stick is not automatically mounted.
This is caused by the stick being added to the fstab file. Plug in your memory stick and check in dmesg
what it got for a device name.

 dmesg | tail

Then edit fstab and remove the line containing the device name.

 sudo gedit /etc/fstab

For example: /dev/sdb1 /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0 0
